// History maintains a history of changes in the reference database. It stores each reference
// creation, update, and deletion applied to it. When further updates are applied, it verifies
// that the resulting state is valid and applies them to the history if so.
//
// History is used to verify logical reference changes of concurrent transactions. By keeping
// track of the change history, reference verification can be performed in memory by applying
// updates to the history and verifying them against past changes. History does not look into
// the on-disk state of the repository. Transactions are expected to be correct in isolation
// and not commit invalid changes. Only conflicts due to concurrent changes are detected.
//
// History maintains a tree where each node represents a component in the path of a reference.
// Inserting `refs/heads/main` results in a tree like `<root>` > `refs` > `heads` > `main`.
// Deleting a reference does not change the tree structure but marks the reference as deleted by
// setting it to zero OID. This means it's possible to have a tree like `refs` > `heads` > `main` > `child`,
// where child is marked as deleted and main is a reference. This ensures that all modifications
// are kept around and can be conflict checked even if the actual operation otherwise would have
// removed a parent node. The tree maintains a count of live child references per node to ensure
// directory-file conflicts can't be introduced. As child is deleted in the example and was not
// live, `main` was allowed to be created even though we still keep the records of `child`'s
// modification around.
//
// History tracks the last LSN that modified each reference. The nodes are cleaned up when Evict()
// is called to drop changes related to a certain LSN. The transaction manager evicts LSNs when it
// no longer needs to keep them around to conflict check. This occurs when there are no writes reading
// snapshots at or below a given LSN.
//
// The LSN that last wrote to a reference is tracked in two maps. referenceByLSN is used by Evict()
// to determine which references were last updated by the LSN that is being evicted. lsnByReference
// is reverse index and keeps track of the last LSN that updated a given reference. This is used
// to keep referenceByLSN up to date when applying updates by removing the updated references from the
// map of the LSN that previously updated it.

// runUploadCommand runs an uploading command like git-upload-pack(1) or git-upload-archive(1). It serves multiple
// purposes:
//
//   - It sets up a large buffer reader such that we can write the data more efficiently.
//
//   - It logs how many bytes have been sent.
//
//   - It installs a timeout such that we can address time-of-check-to-time-of-use-style races. Otherwise it would be
//     possible to open the connection early, keep it open for an extended amount of time, and only do the negotiation of
//     what is to be sent at a later point when permissions of the user might have changed.

		// send. Because access checks only happen at the beginning of the call, it may be the case that the
		// client's permissions have changed since the RPC call started.

		// To address this issue, we thus timebox the maximum amount of time between the start of the RPC call
		// and the end of the negotiation phase. While this doesn't completely address the issue, it's the best
		// we can reasonably do here.
		//
		// To distinguish cancellation of the overall RPC call and a timeout of the negotiation phase we use two

		// for cancellation is that the negotiation phase did not finish in time and thus return a more specific

		// from other errors returned by git-upload-pack(1). So we have to resort to parsing
		// the error message returned by Git, and if we see that it matches we return an
		// error with a `Canceled` error code.

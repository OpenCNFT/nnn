# `gitaly-ruby`

There used to be a 'sidecar' called `gitaly-ruby`, and it was living here. But
it was phased out and now this directory solely exists for downstream projects
that still expect this directory and it's `Gemfile` to be here. In a not so
distant future, this sidecar will only live on in our memories.
